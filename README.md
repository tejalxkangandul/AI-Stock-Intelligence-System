# 🛡️AI-Stock-Intelligence-System

A professional-grade stock analysis and prediction system leveraging **LSTM Deep Learning** and **NLP Sentiment Analysis** to forecast Indian Blue-Chip equities (Reliance, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel).


---

## 🔍 Project Overview
VisionAI is a modular intelligence system designed to bridge the gap between technical indicators and market sentiment. By utilizing a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, the system analyzes 60-day "DNA" patterns of stocks to provide 1-day price targets with a calculated reliability score.

### Key Features:
* **Deep Learning Forecasts:** 1-Day forward price prediction using a multi-feature LSTM model.
* **AI Confidence Scoring:** Real-time assessment of prediction reliability (0-100%) based on current market volatility.
* **NLP News Engine:** Dynamic scraping of Google News RSS with sentiment-coded indicators (🟢/🔴/⚪).
* **Adaptive UI:** Fully reactive Dashboard with Dark/White mode toggles and theme-synced Plotly charts.
* **Centered Design:** Optimized layout with equidistant tabs and a professional trading terminal aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend & UI
* **Streamlit:** Powers the interactive dashboard, sidebar controls, and state management.
* **Plotly:** Renders high-fidelity, interactive candlestick charts that adapt to UI themes.

### Machine Learning & AI
* **TensorFlow/Keras:** Core engine for the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network.
* **Scikit-Learn:** Handles `MinMaxScaler` normalization for multi-dimensional feature sets.

### Data & Analytics
* **yfinance:** Real-time extraction of NSE (National Stock Exchange) historical and live data.
* **Feedparser:** Asynchronous scraping of live financial news headlines via RSS.
* **TextBlob:** Performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine headline sentiment polarity.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** Core libraries for time-series manipulation and technical indicators (RSI, MA7, MA21).

## 🧠 The Working Model

The "brain" of the system is an LSTM architecture specifically chosen for its ability to maintain "memory" of long-term dependencies in time-series data.

### Input Features (Stock DNA)
The model evaluates a 6-dimensional feature vector for every time step:
1. **Close:** The final price of the day.
2. **MA7 & MA21:** Short and medium-term trend indicators.
3. **RSI:** Momentum oscillator to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
4. **Returns:** Daily percentage change.
5. **Volatility:** A standard deviation metric used for both the prediction and the confidence score.

### The Pipeline
1. **Fetch:** Pulls 10+ years of historical data for the selected ticker (e.g., `RELIANCE.NS`).
2. **Process:** Normalizes features and prepares 60-day windows for the LSTM.
3. **Predict:** Outputs the predicted Close price for the next trading day.
4. **Reliability Check:** Calculates a **Confidence Score** by penalizing predictions during periods of extreme market volatility.
